# Ice halo simulation program

This is a personal project for ice halo simulation. It is inspired by
[HaloPoint 2.0](https://www.ursa.fi/blogi/ice-crystal-halos/author/moriikon/). Unfortunately
the author seems have stopped developing.

For a start this program is written in matlab though matlab is often poured scorn on for its
slow performance. It is a prototype, on which I test my algorithms. Later developing and
latest updates will be on C++ codes.

* [Matlab version](matlab)

* [C++ version](cpp)
